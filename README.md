## Google Colab code:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/CleanPegasus/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb

## Dataset :

[German Traffic Sign](https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs)

## Requirements :

> **Use Google Colab for running the model**

The following libraries are required to run the code. But if you are using Google Colab, use need not install these libraries.

> numpy

> matplotlib

> OpenCV

> tensorflow

> Keras

> Pickle

> Random

> Pandas

> Requests

> Pillow

## Procedure :
Run every cell of the notebook. Feel free to modify the code to match your needs.

You can try it with a different dataset containing more classes of signs and change the parameters.

You can try different preprocessing methods for better accuracy.
